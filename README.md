I recently completed TripleTen's Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp and am eager to join the ranks of Data Analyst's everywhere! My favorite part of data analysis is exploration and finding hidden insights in large datasets. I enjoying tackling a challenging problem where I work to uncover approachable answers to tough business questions. I am skilled using Excel and Google Sheets for data cleaning and exploration, as well as proficient in SQL queries and using R for statistical analysis. I am currently looking to find remote work as a Data Analyst with a dynamic company who is using data for good! 

I am a proud Army spouse and you can often find me reading on my Kindle while drinking a London Fog. I always appreciate a new person to expand my network, so please reach out on LinkedIn! </p>
